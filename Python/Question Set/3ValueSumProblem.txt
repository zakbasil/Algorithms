Question:
Design an algorithm that takes as input an array A[] and 
a number k, and determine if there are three entries 
in the array (Not necessarily distinct) which add up to 
the specified number k.

Example:
1.  Input: A = 11,2,5,7,3; K = 21
    Output: true

2.  Input: A = 11,2,5,7,3; K = 22
    Output: false
